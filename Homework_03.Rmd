Problem 1 solved:

First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124


Becomes this:


First String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
```

```
My Solution:

# I used \h{2,} and replaced with ,
#(\s{2,} put everything on one line and did not work)
```

Problem 2 solved:

Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr


Becomes this:


Bryan Ballif (University of Vermont)
Aaron Ellison (Harvard Forest)
Sydne Record (Bryn Mawr)
```

```
My Solution:

# I used (^\w+),(\s\w+),\s(.+$) and replaced with \2 \1 \(\3\)
# At first I tried \2 \1 (\3\) but it needs the backslash infront of (\3\) -- also tried * instead of $ but nothing would highlight/mark.
```
